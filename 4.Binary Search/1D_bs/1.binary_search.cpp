Problem statement: You are given a sorted array of integers and a target, your task is to search for the target in the given array.
 Assume the given array does not contain any duplicate numbers.

Letâ€™s say the given array is = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17} and target = 6.

//iterative solution

int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int n = nums.size(); //size of the array
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;

    // Perform the steps:
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (target > nums[mid]) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

So the overall time complexity is O(logN), where N = size of the given array.

//recursive solution

int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int low, int high, int target) {

    if (low > high) return -1; //Base case.

    // Perform the steps:
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
    else if (target > nums[mid])
        return binarySearch(nums, mid + 1, high, target);
    return binarySearch(nums, low, mid - 1, target);
}

int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    return binarySearch(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1, target);
}

So the overall time complexity is O(logN), where N = size of the given array.
